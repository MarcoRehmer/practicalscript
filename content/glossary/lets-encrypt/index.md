Let's Encrypt is a free, automated and open certification service provided by the [Internet Security Research Group (ISRG)⤴](https://www.abetterinternet.org/).

Every site and every communication over the Internet should be encrypted, which is why Let's Encrypt has set itself the task of providing SSL certificates by simple means, so that every site can switch from HTTP to HTTPS. (HTTPS = encrypted)

## Certbot

The [Certbot⤴](https://certbot.eff.org/) tool is available for easy use. This tool can be used to easily request, renew or delete a certificate. With various plugins, the plugin can be combined with the most common web servers, such as [NGINX](/glossary/nginx).
